# Fruit Quality Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application designed to classify fruits and predict their quality (fresh or rotten) using deep learning. The system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze fruit images and provide predictions with high accuracy.

The application supports the classification of common fruits such as apples, bananas, and oranges and evaluates their quality.
